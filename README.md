# Force-torque-robot-arm-controller
The aim of this project was to develop a force-torque controller for the Schunk LWA4P robot arm. 
The effieceny was proven on an example which is opening a bottle. Important is that the bottle is not fixed and on a table,
which demands force/position and torque/angle control.  The robot used is Schunk LWA4P from IPR, Karlsruhe institute of Technology.
